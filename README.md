# Books-Management-System
This project is a simple Books Management System that allows users to create, read, update, and delete books in a SQLite database. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the database and perform various operations on book records.

# Features:
- Create new books by providing title, author, and publication year.
- View all books in the database.
- Update existing book records with new information.
- Delete books from the database by their unique ID.
- User-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction.
- Utilizes Python and SQLite for data storage and manipulation.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of working with databases, performing CRUD operations, and building a simple user interface in Python. It can be used as a starting point for more advanced book management systems or as a learning resource for data engineering and Python programming.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- SQLite

To get started, clone the repository and run the `code_2.py` script. Make sure to have Python and SQLite installed on your machine. Follow the prompts to create, view, update, and delete books in the database.

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon this project to suit your needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
